 * Canvas resolver — picks providers according to the user's Canvas style:
 *  - ALL:          Race Spotify + ArchiveTune + Glossy (Tidal + Apple) + YouTube
 *                  in parallel and show the first animated canvas that lands.
 *  - GLOSSY:       Tidal + Apple Music (original Glossy engine)
 *  - ARCHIVE_TUNE: BetterLyrics community service (ported from ArchiveTune)
 *  - BOTH:         BetterLyrics first, then Tidal + Apple Music as fallback
 *  - SPOTIFY:      Spotify web-player Canvas, Glossy fallback
 *  - YOUTUBE:      YouTube/InnerTube visualizer clips and #shorts
 *
 * Results are cached per mediaId in CanvasArtworkPlaybackCache so switching
 * songs back and forth is instant. Also exposes prefetch() so the service and
 * the player can warm the cache before the user even opens the player.
 *
 * Every answer a provider gives passes the canvas check ([CanvasVerifier])
 * before it can be used — it has to belong to the song that was asked for, and
 * its URL must not already be known dead. A refused answer is treated exactly
 * like a provider that had nothing, so the others are still worth asking: this
 * is the difference between "the first thing that came back" and "the first
 * thing that came back *for this song*". What the check decided is recorded in
 * [CanvasDiagnostics], which is what the Settings row reports.
