 *
 * YouTube as a canvas source: the visualizer clips and Shorts a label uploads
 * for a song are often the only animated artwork that exists for it.
 *
 * Two things decide whether this provider can answer at all, and both are
 * deliberately chosen here rather than left to the client's playback path:
 *
 *  - **The lookup goes through the app's shared [YouTube] client**, not a
 *    private one. It carries the session's visitor data, proxy and cookies, so
 *    the request looks like the rest of the app's traffic instead of an
 *    anonymous burst YouTube is free to answer with a bot check.
 *
 *  - **The stream URL is asked for with clients that work while signed out.**
 *    A canvas is wanted by everyone, and most people never sign into YouTube in
 *    the app. `WEB_REMIX` — the client the player uses for music metadata —
 *    answers `UNPLAYABLE` / "Video unavailable" for ordinary user-uploaded
 *    clips when there is no account behind it, and its streaming data comes
 *    back with no URL at all without a PoToken. `IOS` answers those same clips
 *    with plain progressive URLs that serve bytes without a signature, a token
 *    or a special User-Agent, and it needs no login, so it is asked first. The
 *    remaining clients are fallbacks for the clips it declines.
 *
 * Answers are cached per song for a day; a lookup that fails outright throws
 * [CanvasLookupUnavailable] so the report can tell "the lookup broke" apart
 * from "YouTube had nothing for this song".
